~~write cipher en/decrypter function~~

~~connect function to website~~

write a good cipher en/decrypter function

make website look pretty

fix menu flickering on page load (caused by jquery, but I don't want to hide the page and then show after javascript because that would break the website if js is disabled in browser)
